# AI Todo Chatbot: A Spec-Driven, Event-Driven Microservices Project

This project is building a production-grade AI Todo Chatbot using a strict Spec-Driven Development (SDD) process. The system is architected as a scalable, event-driven, and cloud-native application composed of decoupled microservices.

The project's principles and technical laws are defined in the [Project Constitution](/.specify/memory/constitution.md).

## Core Architecture

This project is not a monolith. It is a distributed system of microservices that communicate asynchronously via a Kafka event backbone. All infrastructure interactions (e.g., messaging, state, secrets) are abstracted through **Dapr** sidecars, making the system portable and resilient.

- **Event-Driven**: Services are decoupled and communicate via events.
- **Microservices**: Each business domain (e.g., Tasks, Chat, Notifications) is an independent service.
- **Dapr-Enabled**: Dapr provides the abstraction layer for all infrastructure, ensuring portability between local development (Docker) and cloud (Kubernetes).
- **Spec-Driven**: All code is generated by AI agents following a rigorous `Constitution -> Specify -> Plan -> Tasks -> Implement` workflow.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into independent services, each with its own logic and data.

```

## Mandatory Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.11+ with FastAPI (async only)
- **ORM**: SQLModel
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon compatible)
- **Messaging**: Kafka (abstracted via Dapr)
- **Service Abstraction**: Dapr
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (Minikube locally, AKS/GKE/OKE in cloud)
- **Package Manager**: Helm Charts

## Local Development (Coming Soon)

This section will be updated with instructions for running the full microservices stack locally using `docker-compose` and Dapr. The general workflow will be:

1.  **Prerequisites**: Docker, Docker Compose, Dapr CLI.
2.  **Run Services**: `dapr run --app-id <service-name> ...`
3.  **Use `docker-compose`** to bring up the entire environment, including Kafka, Redis, and all services with their Dapr sidecars.

## Kubernetes Deployment (Coming Soon)

This section will provide instructions for deploying the services to a Kubernetes cluster using the provided Helm charts.

1.  **Prerequisites**: `kubectl`, `helm`.
2.  **Start Minikube**: `minikube start`
3.  **Deploy Charts**: `helm install <release-name> helm/<service-name>` for each service.
